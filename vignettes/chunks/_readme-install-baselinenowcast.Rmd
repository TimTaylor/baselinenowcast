To install the development version from GitHub (warning! this version may contain breaking changes and/or bugs), use the [`pak` package](https://pak.r-lib.org/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak(file.path("epinowcast", "baselinenowcast"))
```


*Note: You can also use the above approach to install a specific commit if needed, for example, if you want to try out a specific unreleased feature, but not the absolute latest developmental version.*
